He starred in the 2008 film Twilight, and its four sequels. In the films, he played Jacob Black, a Native American of the Quileute tribe. On the show Scream Queens, he played the son of a black father and a white mother.</p><p>All of Taylor’s maternal grandparents, great-grandparents, and great-great-grandparents are listed as “White” on United States Censuses. No Native American ancestry appears in publicly available family trees of Taylor’s mother. Taylor is a half-second cousin, three times removed, of prominent architect John Lautner.</p><p>The actor was 17 years old in his first filming of Twilight. He landed the famous role of Jacob Black in 2008. Jacob is a native American character in the teen hit series Twilight. The series is based on the best-selling novel by renowned author Stephanie Meyer. How much is Taylor Lautner worth?</p><h2>Where is Lautner from?</h2><p>Lautner was born on February 11, 1992, in<strong> Grand Rapids, Michigan,</strong> the son of Deborah and Daniel Lautner. His mother works for a software development company, while his father was a Midwest Airlines pilot. He has one younger sister named Makena. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Lautner has Dutch, French, and German ancestry, and has stated that he has “distant” Native American ancestry (specifically Odawa and Potawatomi) through his mother. He grew up in Hudsonville,<strong> Michigan,</strong> a town near<strong> Grand Rapids.</strong> He has stated that he was bullied in school because he was an actor. He commented, “I just had to tell myself ‘I can’t let this get to me. This is what I love to do. And I’m going to continue doing it.'”</p><p>He went to public school at<strong> Valencia High School in Santa Clarita, California</strong> until his sophomore year.</p><p>Lautner trained with Chaturantabut for several years, earning his black belt by the age of eight, and winning several junior world championships. He appeared in an ISKA karate event televised on ESPN in 2003 that was later lampooned on the sports-comedy show Cheap Seats that first aired in 2006.</p><p>Lautner, determined to stay in the series, worked out every day and gained over<strong> 30 pounds (14 kg)</strong> of muscle in order to bulk up for the role of Jacob Black in the remaining films in The Twilight Saga. Michelle Lanz of MSN Wonderwall said that Lautner’s change may have saved his career.</p><p>The late 2000s saw Lautner become a teen idol and sex symbol, after extensively changing his physique to keep the role of<strong> Jacob Black</strong> in further Twilight installments, and generating media attention for his looks.</p><p>Lautner spent three months on location in<strong> Austin, Texas,</strong> to film the movie, which was received with negative reviews from critics, and was a minor international success.</p><p>In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham ‘s satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless.</p><h2>Where is Taylor Lautner from?</h2><p>The actor was born on February 11, 1992, in<strong> Grand Rapids, Michigan,</strong> the U.S. Interestingly, he has different ethnic roots.

Previously, the actor is believed to have been dating Selena Gomez; their relationship lasted only three months.</p><h2>How old was Taylor Lautner when he started acting?</h2><p>We tend to think that actors start off their careers with the first audition they go to. That wasn’t the case for Taylor Lautner. He started off at<strong> seven years</strong> old, where he auditioned for a Burger King commercial, but unfortunately, he didn’t get the part.</p><p>14 He Was Bullied<strong> Because He Wanted To Be An Actor.</strong> When Taylor Lautner was in school, he shared his dreams of being an actor with many of his friends and classmates.

Between the two movies he seriously bulked up, gaining<strong> over thirty pounds</strong> of muscle.</p><p>We all know that it’s a huge honor to host SNL, as only the best of the best have hosted it. To top it all off, Taylor was just<strong> 17 years</strong> old at the time of him hosting, as a result, making him one of the youngest celebrities to ever host the show.</p><p>8 Taylor Swift Wrote A Song About Him. We all<strong> know</strong> that Taylor Swift has a long list of exes, but we often forget that Taylor Lautner was one of them. We all know that she infamously writes songs about her exes, and “Back to December” is said to be about Taylor Lautner, and about how it was a mistake to let him go.</p><p>Danielle Gittleman is<strong> a writer and editor</strong> from Freehold, New Jersey. Passionate about music, entertainment, and writing, Danielle has put her love for them together, and specializes in music and entertainment journalism.</p><p>By now we all<strong> know</strong> that Taylor dated<strong> Taylor Swift</strong> — and has a song written about him to make sure we don’t forget.

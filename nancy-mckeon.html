A private person seeking to keep the event small, the two only had 20 guests at the wedding. They moved to a ranch near Austin, Texas to raise their two daughters, Aurora and Harlowe, born in 2004 and 2006, out of the spotlight.</p><p>In 1999, she wrote and directed her own short film, called A Wakening.

In 1994, McKeon and Courteney Cox auditioned for the role of Monica Geller on Friends. The role went to Cox. When asked in interviews about the audition, McKeon said, "I have no hard feelings.

Fox for three years after they met on the set of High School U.S.A. (1983). "He and I were very private people," McKeon told Biography. "We didn't tell a lot of people and we kind of kept to ourselves." McKeon and Fox appeared together as a celebrity couple on the game show Tattletales.</p><p>She was cast as tomboy Jo Polniaczek in the fall of 1980 during the show's second season when four of the first season's cast, including <a href=#>Molly Ringwald</a>, left the show.

In Strange Voices, she portrayed a woman with schizophrenia. She produced many of these movies through her own film company, Forest Hills Entertainment (named after her childhood neighborhood, Forest Hills, on Long Island).</p><p>Early on, McKeon appeared on the soap operas The Secret Storm and Another World. In 1979, she was discovered by a casting director for The Facts of Life on the basis of her performance in a Hallmark advertisement, in which she was able to cry on cue.</p><p>Nancy Justine McKeon (born April 4, 1966) is an American actress.

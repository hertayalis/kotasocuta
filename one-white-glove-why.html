Well, Michael was beginning to develop the vitiligo and it started on his hand."</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Michael was beginning to develop the vitiligo," Cicely continued. "And it started on his hand ... The glove was to camouflage it. That's how that glove came into being."</p><p class=paragraph-text>The interviewer pressed Cicely - who sadly passed away in 2021 - on how she knew this, she went on: "I was there when he was creating it."</p><p class=paragraph-text>According to the NHS website, Vitiligo is "a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/kYAQGzYrQs4/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Michael Jackson's glove story</p><figure>The famous white sequined glove worn by Michael Jackson when he performed Billie Jean at the Grammy Awards in 1983.

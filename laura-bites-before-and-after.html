I think of what it would be like to carry that around in a backpack, like through an airport, and then get to set it down. … My ankle weights and my hand weights together are 20 pounds. And if I think about carrying that around times two, even across a room, I would be tired. … I feel so much better, I had had back pain since the time I was a teenager. I had joint pain, and I thought that I was just going to have it for my whole life because I didn’t think that I was heavy enough that it was affecting my joints. And that pain is all gone. It makes sense to me.”</p><p>Beitz lost the weight amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Lara Beitz (@larabeitz)</a></p><h2>Beitz revealed to Rogan that she shed pounds by participating in Zoom workouts led by a fellow stand-up comic</h2><p>Beitz admitted to Rogan that she has been able to maintain her weight loss thanks to the increase in her physical well-being. She remarked, “My back will pain at the end of the day if I carry a hefty suitcase around an airport right now. I simply do not want that additional weight to return since I have to carry it about with me everywhere I go and in everything I do, even just sitting.</p><p>In addition, Beitz said, “I stopped eating flour and sugar, which I’ve heard are also inflammatory, so I think that might be part of that. The weight’s mere placement down is the other matter, though. I’m in great shape. “I think both are important, for sure,” Rogan continued. Inflammation is undoubtedly a result of processed foods like sugar, wheat, and others, therefore it makes sense that weight is a problem.</p><p>Beitz revealed to Rogan that she uses workouts designed by fellow comedian Stasia Patwell in addition to playing tennis and swimming for exercise. Beitz informed Rogan that the woman was a trainer who had started offering these classes on Zoom for female comics. As a result of her workouts, a number of us underwent before-and-after transformations, showing how several fat comedians transformed into hot individuals. Dude, she’s got a point. She’s f*** hilarious, and she can work you out for an hour while I’m just laughing, feeling like I’m hanging out with a friend. She also has a unique brand of tough love where she’ll call me a p* just as I’m about to fall out of a plank.</p><p></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Has Grimes Gotten Plastic Surgery?

Laura went on: “It was crazy when I suffered an insect bite on my leg a year ago when filming A Place in the Sun with Mark and Janine in France. I just stood there and started scratching it.</p><p>“Oh, I shouldn’t have done that since ITP would produce bruises on my leg,” I thought. “Mark paused and was like, ‘How do you know what ITP is?'” she continued. And he revealed to me with great sadness that his sister had passed away from ITP. He also complimented me on my efforts to raise awareness of the condition. It’s one of those times when you wonder who else they could have been paired with as a presenter because no one was aware of the ITP connection.”</p><h2>Who Is Lara Beitz?</h2><p>American comedian Lara Beitz—some even refer to her as Laura Bites—is well-known worldwide.

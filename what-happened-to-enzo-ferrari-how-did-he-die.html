Alfredo Jr. was his older brother. Ferrari received minimal formal education as a child. When he saw Felice Nazzaro win the Circuito di Bologna in 1908, he was motivated to become a racing driver. Ferrari’s father and brother both perished in a flu pandemic in Italy in 1916. Later, during the 1918 flu pandemic, Ferrari became ill and was released from the army.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Enzo Ferrari die?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Enzo Ferrari</a> died of leukemia on August 14, 1988, in Maranello, at the age of 90. Enzo expressed his desire for his death to be reported in the media only on 16 August, the day after his burial (witnessed only by his family) on 15 August, because he was a private person and feared popular protests because Ferrari’s team had been beaten by McLaren in every race of the 1988 season so far. He was there for the launch of the Ferrari F40, which was dedicated as a symbol of his achievements, just before his death. Ferrari began production of the Enzo, named after its founder, in 2002.</p><p>The Italian Grand Prix was held two weeks after Ferrari’s death, and Ferrari won 1-2, with Austrian Gerhard Berger leading home Italian and Milan native Michele Alboreto; it was McLaren’s sole loss that season. The Scuderia Ferrari team has continued to be successful in the years since Ferrari’s death.</p><p>From 1999 to 2004, as well as in 2007 and 2008, the team won the Constructors’ Championship every year. From 2000 to 2004, Michael Schumacher won the World Drivers’ Championship with Scuderia Ferrari every year, and Kimi Räikkönen won the title in 2007.</p><p>Meanwhile, Enzo Ferrari was born on Febru ary 20, 1898, as the younger of two children to Adalgisa and Alfredo in Modena, Italy. Alfredo Jr. was his older brother. Ferrari received minimal formal education as a child. When he saw Felice Nazzaro win the Circuito di Bologna in 1908, he was motivated to become a racing driver. Ferrari’s father and brother both perished in a flu pandemic in Italy in 1916. Later, during the 1918 flu pandemic, Ferrari became ill and was released from the army.</p><p>He began looking for work in the automobile sector when his family’s carpentry business failed. He eventually landed a position as a test driver for CMN, a vehicle manufacturer based in Milan. Later upgraded to the race car driver, Ferrari made his competitive debut in the 1919 Parma-Poggio di Berceto hillclimb competition. He competed in the Targa Florio race near the end of the year, but had to withdraw after his car’s fuel tank began to leak.</p><p>In 1920, Ferrari joined Alfa Romeo’s racing department as a driver. Three years later, on the Savio Circuit in Ravenna, he won his maiden Grand Prix. Ferrari’s best season was in 1924 when he won races in Ravenna, Polesine, and Pescara. After that, his performance suffered as a result of his grief for the deaths of fellow racers Ugo Sivocci and Antonio Ascari. Ferrari elected to retire from professional racing after the birth of his son Alfredo in 1932, instead focusing on race vehicle administration and development. He concluded his racing career with 11 victories in 41 Grand Prix appearances.</p><p>Ferrari assembled a team of superstar drivers at Alfa Romeo, including Tazio Nuvolari and Giuseppe Campari. Scuderia Ferrari was established in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing branch. The prancing horse image that would become the Ferrari logo was conceived and used first by Italian fighter jet pilot Francesco Baracca, who was killed in action during World War I. Scuderia Ferrari was dissolved in 1937, and Ferrari rejoined Alfa Romeo’s factory racing squad.</p><p>Ferrari quit Alfa Romeo in 1939 after a disagreement with the company’s general director, Ugo Gobbato, and created Auto-Avio Costruzioni, which provided parts to other racing teams. During WWII, his factory was forced to perform. After the war, Ferrari wanted to begin producing automobiles bearing his name, and in 1947, he established his namesake automobile firm. He quickly returned to racing management, launching his own team in 1948, which made its open-wheel début in Turin. The next year, Scuderia Ferrari won its first major race, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6prrZqGSfnaKnrrO1jKGmsGWUnrFutMRmm6KdXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./arrested-development-star-alia-shawkat-pregnant-with-first-baby.html>&#171;&nbsp;Arrested Development star Alia Shawkat is pregnant with her first baby</a>
